## Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16.2.3 (App Router) + React 19.2.4
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + custom theme (dark bg `#0f0e0d`, cream `#f2ead8`, terracotta `#c17a5a`)
- **Fonts**: Playfair Display (serif) + DM Sans (sans) — both via `next/font/google` with `display: swap`
- **Deployment**: Vercel → juancnava.com
- **Analytics**: @vercel/analytics
- **Email**: Resend (`resend` package installed; `RESEND_API_KEY` needed in `.env.local`)
- **Payments**: Stripe (`stripe` package installed; keys set in `.env.local`, price IDs still needed)

## Deployment

| Environment | URL | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Preview alias | https://juancnava.vercel.app | ✓ Always latest — use this for testing |
| Latest deploy | https://juancnava-4f01dlzc3-jnavajr93-1787s-projects.vercel.app | ✓ Live |
| Production | https://juancnava.com | Not yet promoted |

- Project linked to Vercel: `juancnava` (org: `jnavajr93-1787s-projects`)
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/jnavajr93/juancnava (push to `main` to deploy)
- 30 pages built; all routes confirmed READY
- `.env.local` is covered by `.gitignore` (`.env*` rule on line 34) — safe
- Stripe test keys are in `.env.local` locally; **add them to Vercel dashboard** (Settings → Environment Variables) before next deploy so they aren't bundled in the upload
- To promote to production: `vercel --prod` (will ask for confirmation)
- **Deploy workflow:** `git push origin main` → then `vercel --yes` to push to Vercel (GitHub auto-deploy not yet connected in dashboard)

## In Progress

- _Nothing actively in progress_

## Needs To Be Done Before Launch

- [ ] Add Stripe keys + all `STRIPE_PRICE_*` vars to **Vercel dashboard** (Settings → Environment Variables) — currently only in local `.env.local`
- [ ] Create 11 Stripe products in test mode → fill in `STRIPE_PRICE_*` vars
- [ ] Test full Stripe checkout → success flow with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- [ ] Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and Vercel dashboard (resend.com/api-keys — free, 3,000 emails/mo)
- [ ] Verify `bookings@juancnava.com` sender domain in Resend dashboard (or use `onboarding@resend.dev` for local testing)
- [ ] Add actual image files to `public/gallery/` (paths in `lib/gallery.ts`)
- [ ] Add real product images to print detail pages (currently empty placeholder divs)
- [ ] Add real product images to shop hero
- [ ] Connect email service to `/api/subscribe` (stubs for ConvertKit/Mailchimp/Beehiiv are in the file)
- [ ] Decide on open edition prints content (referenced in shop but not yet defined)
- [ ] Update `dateToIso` map in `writing/[slug]/page.tsx` when adding new essays
- [ ] Replace generic OG image on print pages once real print photos are uploaded (`print.src` → `/gallery/*.jpg`)
